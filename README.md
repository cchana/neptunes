# The Neptunes Archive

A visual look at every song produced by The Neptunes from the 1990s up until today.

Feel free to fork this project and adapt it for other artists, just attribute the project or the original site found at https://theneptunes.1thingaweek.com

## How to update for other artists

In theory, this project can be used to represent the timeline for any type of artist. Musicians, directors, actors and more.

To do so, update the data.json file with the information about their projects. The file is broken down in the following way:

- DECADE (eg. 1990)
-- YEAR (eg. 1991)
--- BODY OF WORK (eg. Album title)
---- SPECIFICS (eg. Song title)

I'd love to see what others do with this project, get in touch [@cchana](https://twitter.com/cchana).
